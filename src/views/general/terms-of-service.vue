<p>üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Terms of Use</p>
<p>1. General
These Terms of Use govern the downloading and use of Openspace.Social on any of its users' devices (computer, laptop, tablet, and other similar devices). These Terms of Use will also apply to every software update and may be amended in the future.
If users do not agree with any of the terms laid down below, they will not be able to avail of any of the services offered by Openspace.Social.

<p>
2. Our Service
Openspace.Social offers you a platform where you can share your content with other members of the platform. You can join and discover several communities and make friends in a friendly and safe environment.
Our services are offered to all users equally, as the platform is built to be secure by design and makes no use of algorithms favouring any user. We strongly believe in embracing diversity and polite and respectful behaviour. Therefore, our community-crafted guidelines will set the right foundation to foster an ethical, social network.
</p>
<p>
3. Using Openspace.Social
Openspace.Social requires users to be sixteen (16) years of age or over in order to use our services. When making an account, prospective users are obliged to be truthful and disclose accurate information.

<p>
4. Your Content
We don't claim ownership over any content that you post on Openspace.Social. "Content" means any content that you're able to upload or post on Openspace.Social, including text, images, files, animations, logos, or comments. However, when you post or transfer content to Openspace.Social, you give us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, transferable license to use, store, reproduce, adapt (so we can properly post your content), distribute, and publicly display your content in order to make it accessible through Openspace.Social.
We reserve the right to remove any user content that we believe violates any copyrights, and any of our Terms and Conditions, including our Licence Agreement and the Community Guidelines.

</p>
<p>
6. Security
At Openspace.Social, we do our best to make our platform as secure as possible. However, given our background in information security, we recognize that there is no such thing as a fully secure platform given the ever-growing list of digital and physical attack vectors. We cannot guarantee that our services will not be interrupted. Openspace.Social users are solely responsible for their account information, which is why we ask users to keep their passwords secure and limit the amount of personal information disclosed on Openspace.Social.
Users are also obliged to notify us of any compromises to security or any unauthorized use of Openspace.Social accounts. Any incidents or suspicions of unauthorized use of Openspace.Social accounts and security breaches are to be reported to admin@Openspacelive.com.
</p>
<p>
7. Third-Party Links
Openspace.Social threads may contain links to websites that are not owned by Openspace.Social. These include links posted by our affiliates, partners, and other users. These links are not owned or controlled by Openspace.Social.
Openspace.Social assumes no responsibility for any of the damages that arise out of or in connection to users entering these websites. It is at the user's discretion to enter these websites, and they should be aware of any risks and take the necessary precautions while doing so. Any complaints regarding these third-party links should be directed to the third party.

‚Ä¢	If users are found to use Openspace.Social (accounts) to facilitate illegal activities
‚Ä¢	If users are found to violate any laws
‚Ä¢	Violations of copyrights and other relevant intellectual property rights
It is important to note that some of the terms in these Terms of Use may still be valid even after termination has been carried out by any party. This includes, but is not limited to, the copyright policy, the Limitation of Liability clause (Term 10), and the arbitration clause (Term 11). It is, therefore, the user's responsibility to be informed of which terms will still be valid.

These disputes will first be resolved informally through arbitration. This arbitration procedure will be carried out in Canada and will be governed by the Arbitration Act of the respective province.
